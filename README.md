# Station metadata integration of regional seismic networks in the southern Korean Peninsula

Station metadata for the 546 stations of the regional seismic networks being operated in the Southern Korean Peninsula were integrated. The bibliographic and index data regarding the installations and change histories of seismic stations administered by the Korea Meteorological Administration, Korea Institute of Geoscience and Mineral Resources, and Korea Institute of Nuclear Safety from their initial installation to July 2023 were collected through the responses in their instruments.</br>

We understand that station conditions can change from time to time. Therefore, we would be grateful if you could suggest or provide us with any information needed to update the metadata presented here. We also ask you to provide feedback if you find any errors in the existing information.</br></br>
